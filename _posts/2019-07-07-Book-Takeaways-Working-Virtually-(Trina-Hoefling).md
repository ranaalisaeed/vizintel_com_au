## Chapter 7 - Virtual leadership differentiators

**Virtual managers** must do fours things better
* They must effectively *communicate* and facilitate others' communication face-to-face, virtually, in writing and audio-visually through web/audio conferences
* They must *manage by results* with a focus on coaching and development
* They must *trust* employees and provide coaching based on team members' stages of virtual effectiveness
* They must *facilitate introductions* and career growth opportunities

Team members face a number of **predictable barriers to performance** (common complaints)
* Reliance on other teams who don't prioritize your team's needs
* Organization politics and cultures of cynicism
* Geographic, temporal, language and cultural differences
* (Un)reliable technology
* Difficult people

A a virtual leader, do not shy away from team frustration, irritation, member withdrawal or disengagement. Focus less on task and more on relationships on and beyond the team. **Relationship management** can be planned, supported and even measured. Help your team members have access to needed influencers. 

Virtual team members typically go through four stages of **personal adaptation to the virtual work environment**: excitement, disappointment, confusion, and synergy. You will coach members up the learning curve. You are not coaching to job competence, that is assumed. Coach to the real issue (related to virtual work environment).

Structure, procedures and rules are the servant of the team, not the ruler. They are in place to serve the delivery goals, not enslave people to unnecessary rules. 

#### Virtual leader competencies
Commit to purposefully and intentionally support your team and the organization in achieving meaningful strategic goals. 
1. **Building Commitment, Not Control**: Building commitment in small steps until the team stops transacting and begins cooperating.
2. **Focus, Coordinate, and Communicate - Don't Authorize, Command, or Plan**
3. **Connect, Don't Gate-Keep**: Network up, down, and across to make your team known by upper management. 
4. **Manage by Results, Not by Sight**: The question "How can I manage virtual team performance?" is better reframed as "How do I support collaboration and teamwork so that we reach our targets?"
5. **Coach, Don't Manage**: The coaching axiom is to praise publicly and through all media; give constructive feedback privately and in person. 
6. **Dialogue, Don't Dictate**: Team are more likely to innovate when they freely share experience and knowledge through intentional conversation. Collaborative work needs healthy conflict and active debate in order to generate ideas. Facilitate your team's ability to test and experiment quickly through prototype, reflection, and adjustment. Work focused conversation should lead somewhere - a decision to try something before analysis paralysis sets in, a creative resolution to a stubborn problem, combining multiple opposing ideas into a better option. Help the team reach majority agreement, if not consensus, coming back together after robust debate. The better team discusses together - debating, exploring, assessing, deciding, designing, trying, adjusting - the more agile it can be. 
7. **Blend Technology and People**: Use technology to connect people and build team intimacy (the willingness to pass on honest information)
8. **Integrate, Don't Comply**: Help team members integrate their work with the team, and the team's work with the organization. Be the duct tape for your team. 

## Chapter 8 - Henhouses and Jazz Musicians

When a team values harmony and alignment over accurate analysis and critical evaluation, a phenomenon called groupthink can set in. Groupthink encourages disagreement and leads to individuals unquestionably following the majority. One false assumption in a decision-making process could mean the team is acting from faulty foundations putting results at risk. To avoid this, see the team's work from different perspectives. 

* An analytical person finding operational strengths and weaknesses of various options with an eye towards quality control. 
* A people-oriented teammate looks at the impact on people with an eye toward advocacy for all stakeholders. 

Diverse teams harness collective intelligence because multiple perspectives are considered. Teams made up of similar team members consistently underperform diverse teams. Similar experience, backgrounds and personalities tend to share similar perspectives and approaches. They enjoy working together because they think and work similarly, they also fail more often. 

Personality profiles and temperament assessments are a popular way to ensure team diversity that is more than just race or culture. 

* Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
* DiSC
* StrengthFinders

Four criteria of a team
* Team charter - we have a purpose
* Interdependent - we can't do it without each other
* Committed - we want to be part of this team
* Accountable - others are counting on what we do together

#### Managing a henhouse
Managing folks who do not need to interact with each other much

* More falls to the virtual manager
* Autonomy doesn't encourage cooperation
* Cooperation increases commitment to the company
* Cooperation increases commitment to the team
* Cooperation increases people's desire to help

#### Motivating today's team

> Every person has one of three driving motivators: the need for achievement, affiliation, or power - David McClelland

None of the three motivators are inherent; we develop them through culture and life experiences. Power and achievement are not what motivations most workers today, particularly with the influx of millennials in the workforce. Their life experiences give rise to the driving motivator of *affiliation*. Workers are motivated when they work with an organization that is contributing 'meaningful work'. We want to be part of something bigger and most important than ourselves, communities we are proud to be part of. 

Find people who like what they do and see the value they provide.

## Chapter 10 - Develop your team

> Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships - Michael Jordan

Team members work best when they are complementary rather than competitive. 

#### Team development stages
1. Forming - Communicate strengths and weaknesses of each member and why each was selected. Structure ways for team to know each other, team's goals and plans
2. Storming - Facilitate working team out of inevitable team disagreements and misunderstandings and focus on teamwork
3. Norming - Agreements and planning settle in. Find team rhythm
4. Performing - high-performing team working well and able to course correct
5. Renorming - ongoing teams go through a period of adjustment when work environments change, members roll off, new members join
6. Adjourning - last stage for temporary/project teams. adjourn with celebration at the completion of project and provide assistance for redeployment

#### Team development activities
* *Getting acquainted*: Getting to know team members. Bring team together in person. Face to face interactions
* *Team charter, vision, values*: Governance
* *Team project planning*: confirm project goals, identify resources, set milestones and deliverable deadlines, delineate everyone's roles and responsibilities, decide how to share and embed learning, team norms, and team reflection time
* *Team processes*: 
* *Communication and collaboration tool infrastructure*: Training on the tools and reinforce their usage. Define collaboration guidelines together. Build relationships and establish stakeholder communications
* *Membership and maintenance*: Agree on how the team wants to be supported, managed and evaluated

#### Team charter and parameters
* Team purpose/project justification (problem or opportunity addressed)
* Reorganization and stakeholder expectations
* Team goals and deliverables
* Success criteria (including project metrics such as schedule, cost, quality, innovations and improvements)
* Deadlines and milestones
* Scope and authority of team, roles, and team influence
* Metrics, team evaluation, compensation, and recognition
* Scope management issues (including ways that scope changes will be handled and contract change orders will be processed)

## Chapter 11 - Support your team

> We all do better when we all do better - Paul Wellstone

Management is a social function. We are not going to breed a new race of supermen. We will have to run our organizations with people as they are. The essence of management is to make people and their expertise productive.

**Teamwork is fundamentally social, regardless of whether the team is virtual**. Unless you are managing a henhouse, you do not want to be your team's primary relationship at work. Team leaders support their team by unleashing talent, connecting to resources and removing obstacles. 

**Manager as facilitator and servant leader**. Servant leaders are the beneficiaries of important contacts, information and insights that make them more effective and productive in what they do even though they spend a great deal of their time sharing what they learn and helping others through such things as career counseling, suggesting contacts, and recommending new ways of doing things. 

#### Four Flow Starters for team
1. Give the team influence
2. Make the work intrinsically rewarding by deploying to strength and passion
3. Set up and use multiple sources of feedback, including project and task management tools
4. Help team members protect their space for focus without interruption

#### Conversations and trust
Conversations are an irreplaceable way that relationships develop. Managers have to facilitate team's talk, at least at first. We often ask team members to trust one another and be interdependent. Trust is tentatively given, it's not guaranteed to continue. We give it temporarily until experience proves trust is deserved. Research shows that high performing teams maintain high trust through social communication interweaved with task-based conversations. 

#### Cooperate with compassion
Compassion at work is not automatic. Approximately 66% of team members in a survey stated they would "extend more effort if my supervisor listened to me and cared". Three compassion behaviors at work:

1. Take the other person's perspective - When we truly understanding where someone is coming from, we become less judgmental
2. Be available to listen - should be available to help one another
3. Remember a time when ... - to appreciate someone else's struggle, remember a time when you were struggling

#### Virtual teams experience energy leaks
Develop a habit of posting fun and exciting news to a team dashboard or shared stream. Celebrate accomplishments as a team, even when dispersed. Celebrate again when you're face to face. 

#### Churn and on-boarding: Entry, Exit, Reentry
Here are the questions to guide team members who are rolling onto the team:

* What reference documents, history, strategic-planning documents, progress plans, and deliverable requirements do joining team members need to review? Can you create a static infographic road map, or will a more dynamic orientation be needed?
* Whom do joining team members need to talk to, and about what? Structure their on-boarding plan. 
* Who will serve asa an orientation coach? A work buddy? Make it easy for people to know where/who is the first point of contact for what kind of help
* How will new team members learn the operating norms of this team? Don't leave people to watch and learn through trial and error
* HOw will new team members be introduced to the existing team? Hopefully, it won't be just before the new team member's first report out

* Project and task management - Basic tasking, resource entry, status, adaptation, and reporting; assign actions required and follow-ups, and name project owners by using the tools during team meetings, or post soon after each meeting

## Chapter 14 - Practical guidelines for virtual communication

> You can have brilliant ideas, but if you can't get them across, your ideas won't get you anywhere - Lee Iacocca

Five C's of purposeful team communication
* **Clarity** - have I checked the team member's understanding of task, authority, responsibility?
* **Connection to purpose** - Is the team member connected to me, the team, the organization? 
* **Candor** - willingness to be honest and bring all relevant information. when talking, are we communicating candidly and authentically?
* **Cocreation** - collectively create and innovate together. Be inclusive. Ask for input from everyone
* **Commitment check** - Verify to help everyone stay on point. Follow up on commitments. Focus on the whole person. People are more than their job descriptions. 

The four Ps of Communication flow

1. *Pushed communication* is important, timely and necessary enough to intrude people's days to get through. 
2. *Pulled information* is available to find when needed, from a resource, such as a database or picking a mentor's brain.
3. *Posted information* is information that is posted for viewing as needed, such as shared network or bulletin board.
4. *Positioned communication* informs people about what is coming so they can be prepared, such as change related communication.

#### Team learning
Gestalt Psychology discovered that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. A team should be more "intelligent" collectively that any individual is alone. This is the power of teams and on significant source of innovation. Therefore communication infrastructure should include cooperative discovery, intentional dialog, deeper conversation, and informal chatting so that people can think better together.
