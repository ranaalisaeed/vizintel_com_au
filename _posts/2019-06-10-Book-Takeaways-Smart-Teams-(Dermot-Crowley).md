## Introduction 

Costs of the a less-than-effective productivity culture are usually things like long hours, stress, lack of balance and high turnover, even in highly successful organizations. There are four main productivity issues we face when we work together in complex environments:

- **Information overload**, too many emails and juggling with numerous other information systems, including instant messaging, phone calls, voice mail, collaboration tools, customer management systems and project dashboards. Studies suggest our stress levels start to elevate when we receive more than 50 emails a day
- Too much **time in unfocused meetings**
- Distractions and **interruptions**
- Unnecessary **urgency**

Due to these productivity issues, we experience work friction rather that flow. Everything appears harder. Things take longer. We have to chase everything up. Rework means we get behind, which causes more urgency. And the cycle goes on. We feel like we have no control or power to change these friction-causing factors. This is just the way it is!

There must be a better way.

Many friction cultures feel like they're always short on resources. There is much talk about how short-staffed we are, how we have too much to do and not enough time, so we can’t get anything done.

In flow cultures, we not only use our time more effectively because we are organized, focused and proactive, but we get more done because we are resourceful. We find a way. We work it out. We're in control of getting what's important done on time.

**Game theory productivity**: Our team is most productive when we work in a way that is productive for ourselves as individuals, and productive for the team as a whole. Based on Nash's Equilibrium, best result actually comes from everyone in a group doing what is best for themselves, and for the group.

While some of our work is done alone, most of it involves working with others. When we work with others we cooperate , working together to achieve shared results. We commonly do this in the context of communications, meetings and projects, although we may cooperate in many other ad-hoc ways.


## What is productivity friction
Friction is the loss of productivity and effectiveness that occurs in the ‘gap’ between two people. It is 
- that brief loss of focus when we are distracted by an interruption
- the wasted time spent in a meeting that has no agenda and no real focus
- the frustration we feel when an urgent request derails our day and the priorities we had planned
- the sense of overwhelm we feel every time we open our inbox to find hundreds of new messages waiting for our attention.

## Poor productivity behaviors

- **Meetings**: turning up late, arriving unprepared, wrong invitees, failure to follow through, meetings called at short notice, fuzzy agendas
- **Emails**: too many, unclear communications, long winded with desired actions buried in body, unnecessary cc list, fuzzy subjects, every email marked ‘urgent’
- **Improper delegation**: wrong people for the job, late delegation, no time taken to delegate well, delegate responsibility but not power, micromanage delegation, not enough support when needed
- **Interruptions**: too many, lack of awareness and empathy for others, making negotiation hard for others, every interruption is ‘urgent’
- **Deadlines**: leave work tasks until last minute, create unnecessary urgency, expect instant responses, forget or fail to meet deadlines

*Aggregation of marginal gains*: 1% improvements in different areas such as training, diet and aerodynamics would aggregate to a massive overall improvement

> The group norm must not dictate our behaviors. Our behaviors must dictate the group norm.

Imagine a culture in which everyone is highly managing their time and priorities. Imagine a culture in which people actively work to enhance their own productivity as well as the productivity of others. Imagine a culture in which productivity is embedded in the DNA of the organization.

## Smart team qualities

- **Purposeful**: they work with purpose on the right activities
- **Mindful**: mindful of how our behaviors affect others. Inward mindfulness (awareness of what is happening with own own focus/attention) is essential in an email-heavy, interruption-driven workplace, however, outward focus is more important to minimize friction our behaviors could create for others around us. Examples of poor outward facing mindfulness are generating volumes of noise for our colleagues, being distracted in meetings, rushing work and making mistakes causing rework for others.
- **Punctual**: we turn up on time, and deliver on time.
- **Reliable**: we do what we say we'll do. We should work in a way that our team can rely on us. We must take ownership and be accountable for our work, our deadlines and our promises. Control your work and be accountable for what you deliver. Take responsibility of saying ‘no’ and negotiating your workload when appropriate

We're always busy, but busyness is not enough in a high-performing team

> It is not enough to be busy. So are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about? - Henry David Thoreau

## Changing team behaviors

Qualities of a smart team outlined earlier combine to deliver powerfully productive outcomes:
- When we are *purposeful* and *mindful*, we create **focus**
- When we are *mindful* and *punctual*, we ensure we treat our colleagues with **respect**
- *Punctuality* and reliability ensure we build **trust** with our co-workers and clients
- When we are *reliable* and *purposeful*, we create **impact**

Keeping the four team qualities in mind, we need to combat the productivity issues we see in our workplace. Qualities alone are insufficient to change team behaviors, and also, nature of these qualities makes accountability problematic. For example, had to tell if Kelly is more or less purposeful this month compared to last month.

To create real change, we need to go from general to specific. We need to define *Productivity principles* that will shape the culture of our team; they should live and breathe in every meeting, every interaction, every delegation, every project and every email.

#### Productivity principles
{:.no_toc}
Productivity principles are tangible examples of a quality in action (applied to situation). They are clearly defined and specific to a situation. It is generally easy to tell whether or not the principle has been followed.

Examples of productivity principles
- *punctuality* applied to meetings
	- Turn up on time
	- Finish meetings on time
	- Deliver on meeting actions in a timely way
	- Use an agenda to manage meeting time in a meeting
- *mindful* applied to emails
	- Reduce email noise for the team
	- Copy or CC with purpose
	- Switch to a direct conversation
	- make it easy for the reader

Create a list of relevant, impactful productivity principles for your team. And this should not be a one-off exercise. Other productivity issues will crop up from time to time, so you should review this list every 6-12 months, checking that you are still following all the behaviors and whether other may be needed to be added.

*Adopting this list will begin to change behaviors and shape the culture. But it is the exercise of coming together as a group and discussing, debating and agreeing on solutions that ensures a positive shift*

Stephen believes the problem is organizations don’t involve their people enough in the change process. ‘They try to do change to people rather than involving people in the change. So change is something that happens from the top down.’ This is why I believe it is critical to generate your own set of productivity principles as a team. If you just distribute a list of productivity principles and dictate that this is how the team is going to work from this point forward, nothing will change. You need to involve the team and forge agreements, rather than just mandate rules or protocols.

## Cooperation

#### 5W Cooperation Framework
When we cooperate with others in the workplace, it is usually on a project, in a meeting, when we interrupt someone, when we delegate work, or when are sending a written communication. Always, such interaction could be improved by asking the following questions
- Why: Start with why, first clarify.
- What (why this?): what outcome do you want to achieve?
- Who (why them?): are they the right people?
- When (why now?): is this the best time?
- Where (why here?): is this the best place or environment?

## Communication

We have four main ways to communicate
- conversation: same-time activity. face-to-face, by phone or instant messaging (IM)
- meeting: same-time activity.
- email: Email is best used when *content* is most important, such as attached documents
- post: a message broadcast on a shared platform

![](/assets/images/Figure_communication_tools.png)

Email is very useful and usable tool, but is much over-used in current workplaces
> when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail

#### 3W approach to planning communications

- **Planning effective communications (Why)**: What outcome do you want to achieve? Do you need someone to *do* something? Do you simply need a timely *response*? Do you need a *decision* made? Are you just providing *information* to one or a number of people?

- **Writing effective communications (What)**: Your reader is usually busy, distracted, bored, on the run or overwhelmed. Or all of the above. If you want to get cut-through in a world where 100-plus messages a day is normal, you need to stand out by writing well-structured and concise communications that help the reader to understand the issue, question, request or recommendation quickly. 

  > Mark Twarin once apologized in a letter to his brother for writing such a long letter, explaining that he did not have time to write a short one. Writing brief but instructive emails takes more time, which may be less 'efficient' but is a lot more effective.

  Three main ingredients of good communication and SSS approach
  - focus: a strong SUBJECT line creates FOCUS
  - clarity: a clear SUMMARY line provides CLARITY
  - context: Appropriate SUPPORTING INFORMATION provides CONTEXT  
<br />

  Subject line prefixes
  - ACTION: recipient is required to take action
  - SIGN: recipient's signature is required
  - INFO: No action is needed (for information only)
  - DECISION: recipient is required to make and communicate a decision
  - REQUEST: sender seeks recipient's agreement or approval
  - COORD: coordination is needed between sending and recipient  
<br />

  Top 12 email writing tips
	1. Keep email short and to the point. Brevity is not rude.
	2. Write a relevant subject line that describes the purpose of the email
	3. Summarize the issue, question or recommendation in the first paragraph
	4. List any actions required near the top of the email
	5. Where possible, frame the email to require a simple yes or no response
	6. If you require a more complex response, give the reader an A, B or C choice
	7. Outline what you expect to happen in different scenarios
	8. Format the email using headers, paragraphs and bullet points to help the reader digest the information
	9. Use subject codes such as ACT or FYI to communicate what is required in the subject line
	10. Review what you have written before you send it, and tighten it up even more
	11. Spellcheck every email
	12. Don't expect actions from people you have copied by CC  
<br />

- **Sending effective communications (who)**: Think about the noise you generate for your colleagues and team. There are three main categories of emails we receive:
	- action emails
	- informational emails
	- junk emails  
<br />

  Noise can be created by
  - CC emails that do not add value for the recipient
  - nonessential Reply All conversations in which the recipient is an observer rather than a participant
  - thank you emails (most of the time)
  - emails sent to a general distribution list rather than a more targeted group
  - system-generated emails that duplicate other workflows
  - nonessential chatter and discussion

## Congregation

Poor meeting behaviors
- stepping in and out of the room to take calls during the meeting
- doing emails instead of being attentive
- staying quiet in the meeting, but raising issues afterwards
- dominating the discussion unreasonably
- dismissing the points of view of others
- having side conversations when someone is talking
- hijacking the agenda

Meeting reduction/improvement strategies

- **reduce number of meetings by 25% over a month**

- **reduce average length of meetings by 25%**: In a humorous essay in *The Economist* in 1955, C. Northcote Parkinson proposed that 'work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion', now known as Parkinson's Law.

- **reduce number of participants in each meeting by 25%**: Research suggests that including any more than seven participants in a meeting makes decision making harder. In fact, a study by Bain & Company found that every attendee over seven reduced the decision effectiveness by 10%. In larger groups, everyone may have an opinion, which can complicate clear decision making. Larger groups (if well facilitated) may work well when the meeting purpose is to brainstorm or generate ideas, but often less is more. Few strategies to reduce the number of participants in meetings:
	- List the participants and their reason for attending
	- Create an agenda and invite people based on this
	- Use the 'Required' field only for people who must attend
	- Use the 'Optional' field for those participants who are not essential, but who you feel should have the option to attend if they wish  
<br />

- **reduce time wasted in meetings by 25%**: Well-planned meetings with a clearly stated purpose that are attended by the right people and are driven by a strong agenda will get the most out of the allocated time for all involved. Instead, fuzzy meetings often start a bit late, have no clear direction or agenda, and finish as participants of the next meeting are knocking on the door. They also probably end without any clear actions or decisions, which may require a further meeting to establish. Strategies to help reduce wasted time in meetings
	- Plan the meeting beforehand, including establishing the meeting purpose and agenda
	- Send the agenda to participants well ahead of the meeting
	- Distill supporting information to make it easy for the attendees to grasp
	- Begin the meeting by focusing everyone on the agenda
	- Run the agenda to time
	- Redirect new topics to a ‘parking lot’ for future meetings
	- Manage personalities that may derail the meeting agenda
	- Ensure participants capture and own their actions
	- Pause and agree on the best use of the final ten minutes
	- Evaluate every meeting

#### 5W approach to planning meetings
Asking 'W questions' in the right sequence is a great way to organize any meeting. A general rule of thumb is to invest 20 per cent of the meeting duration on planning the event. This of course should be done before the meeting. So for a 45-minute meeting, plan on spending at least ten minutes on planning.

![Figure 5W approach to planning meetings](/assets/images/Figure_5W_to_planning_a_meeting.png)


- Why: **Set the purpose**. Create a meeting purpose statement by completing the sentence '*The purpose of this meeting is to ...*'
- What: **Create the agenda**. An agenda should
	- clarify the thinking of the organizer
	- communicate what will be covered in the meeting
	- focus the thinking of the participants
	- help the participants to prepare for the meeting
	- allow potential participants to negotiate if they believe they are not the right person
	- focus the meeting itself
	- manage time in the meeting
	- rank the agenda items in priority order.
- Who: **Choose the resources**. Have a meeting agenda template with an additional element: a section in which the meeting organizer had to list the meeting participants invited, and why they were required
- Where: **Create the right environment**
- When: **Work the timing**. It is important to give people as much notice as possible when requesting a chunk of their time. Last-minute meetings, or meetings scheduled for the next day, can throw other people’s plans into chaos. Avoid this if at all possible. It is worth considering placing time constraints on each agenda item, allocating the number of minutes that can be spent on the item. This will create a sense of focus for all attendees before and during the meeting. The agenda timing will also serve as a critical tool to help the meeting convener to keep on track. Once the allocated time for an agenda item is used up, the convener should note this and direct the group to make a decision about whether they stay with the item at the expense of other items or place it in a parking lot to be dealt with further outside the meeting. A prioritized agenda will help with this decision making.

#### Agenda items
{:.no_toc}
![Meeting agenda types](/assets/images/Figure_meeting_agenda_types.png)

- **Creation**: Brainstorming, planning or ideation. Use *divergent* activity for lots of ideas, then use *convergent* activity to prioritize the results and narrow down to few.
- **Deliberation**: Decisions, approvals or recommendations. Key is to have the right number of people, max 7.
- **Delegation**: Team tasks, requests or resource allocation.  
- **Presentation**: Briefing, update or speech.

## Collaboration

Projects are one of most common ways we collaborate with one another in the workplace to get stuff done. Key elements of collaboration

![Elements of collaboration](/assets/images/Figure_elements_of_collaboration.png)

- **Alignment**: Get everyone on the same page
- **Agreement**: Set the rules of engagement. How we will work together, what tools we'll use to collaborate, how we'll communicate, meet, raise issues and update progress. 
- **Awareness**: Monitor and manage behaviors. By applying *game theory productivity* thinking to our collaborations, we can elevate our awareness so we view all our collaborations from the perspective of both our own effectiveness and the productivity of the people we work with. 

Two aspects of attention
- one focused on your own task (*attention in*), and
- the other open to understanding what's required by the team as a whole (*attention out*)

Three main distractions to guard against:
- electronic distractions: such as emails and instant messaging alerts. Turn these off and instead check at regular times. 
- personal distractions: capture your thoughts for later and get back to what you were doing. 
- human interruptions: put some visual sign that you're trying to concentrate, such as headphone or focus room. When interrupted, we try to multitask and therefore get stressed and frustrated, deal with it with *intentional switching* in one of two ways
	- intentional switching option 1: completely stop what you were doing and give full attention to the person
	- intentional switching option 2: ask the person if they could wait for you to finish what you're doing so you can give them your full attention

#### Project collaboration
5W Cooperation Framework adopted for projects (4W)
- Why (**Purpose**): Ask the following questions to really understand the why
	- Why are we doing this project?
	- What business outcomes does this project link to?
	- What will the project achieve in terms of business outcomes?
	- What is the opportunity cost in doing this project? What will we not do as a result?
	- Is this the best use of our time, energy, money and resources?
	- What parts of organization will be affected by the project?
- What (**Objectives, Deliverables, Tasks**)
	- **Objectives** describe what will be different after the project's completion. What issue will be resolved? What new system will be in place? What product will be brought to market? Important part of *alignment* to get everyone on the same page
	- **Deliverables** are physical or tangible outputs the project will deliver - actual tool or product, or a change to a business process. For example, in a project to design a new productivity training program, one deliverable might be the training workbooks, another the slide presentation, and yet another the marketing collateral. These are all physical deliverable within the project. Deliverables are useful, because they provide a contextual way to organize the project tasks.
	- **Tasks** (Work breakdown structure) are all the things that need to be done before you can say the deliverable has been completed
- Who (**Leadership, Resources, Stakeholders**)
- When (**Deadlines, Schedule, Progress**)

A good collaboration tool should be
- **Useful**, must add value and help us do our job. 
- **Usable**, easy to use
- **Used**, should be used by all the relevant people

#### Negotiating Urgency
Choose an appropriate 'response' to urgency, taking into account the politics of the situation, the people involved and the consequences of your actions. 
- **Ignore** false and/or unreasonable urgency
- **Negotiate** false and reasonable urgency
- **Question** real but unreasonable urgency
- **Respond** to real and reasonable urgency  

Note none of these options involve the work '**react**'. *React* and *Respond* are different, reacting means dropping everything in exceptional circumstances.

Developing an active mindset and moving away from being reactive

![Develop an active mindset](/assets/images/Figure_developing_an_active_mindset.png)

#### Managing expectations
Especially with email requests, use SSSH strategy to manage others' expectations and buy yourself some time:
- Send a timely ack
- Set an expectation about when you could do the task
- Schedule the activity so you don't forget
- Hold yourself accountable for delivering or renegotiating

#### Delegation Framework
`TODO` Read about these approaches
- hands-on approach
- hands-off approach
- on-hand approach
- hold-hand approach

## Building a smart team culture
The books provide a list of useful projects to transform team culture. Read the book for those. 


## The first action I took after reading the book
I decided to work improvement my communications. In particular, they way I send out emails and the way I'd like others to send me emails. I redid my email signature by reducing it from several lines long to three lines (name, title and contact) and also adding a note & few points about how I'll help minimize email noise at my workplace. I discussed it with my manager and they were happy for me to take this initiative. So here is how my email signature looks like now

**Firstname, Lastname**  
Title, Team, Organization  
Cell: 0400 xxx xxx  
*To be purposeful in my work and mindful of yours, I'll contribute to reducing email noise by*  
-- *minimising 'Thankyou' emails (so thanks if I've asked you for something)*  
-- *replying with care, avoiding the use of 'Reply All'*  
-- *not having mails up all the time (I'll check emails 3 times a day, if it's urgent, please contact me on my cell)*  
-- *prioritising emails marked 'to' me over those where I'm copied (cc)*  

*Thank you Dermot for this book*.
