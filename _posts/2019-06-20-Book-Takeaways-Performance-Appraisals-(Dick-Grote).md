## Chapter 1. Why bother with Performance Appraisal?

Performance appraisal requires managers to stand in judgment of each person on their team, to evaluate just how well or how poorly they have performed, and then to review that assessment face to face. Very few people enjoy having their performance analyzed, documented, and discussed. It's one of the hardest things we ask people in leadership positions to do. 

A performance appraisal is a formal record of a manager's *opinion* of the quality of an employee's work. 

Academic research has demonstrated that identifying the poorest-preforming 10% of an organization's employees, terminating them, and replacing them with higher-performing replacements significantly improves the quality of the workforce. *Source: Steven E. Scullen, Paul K. Bergey, and Lynda Aiman-Smith, "Forced distribution Rating Systems and the Improvement of Workforce Potential: A Baseline Simulation," Personnel Psychology 58 (2005): 1-32*

Job performance is made up of two components
- **Results** - what the person accomplishes: goal setting and key responsibilities of the job, the results come here
- **Behaviors** - how the person goes about achieving those results: the behaviors or competencies that generate those results come here

## Chapter 2. Goal Setting

Research findings from "*Building a Practically Useful Theory of Goal Setting and Task Motivation: A 35-Year Odyssey*" Edwin A. Locke and Gary P. Latham 2002. 

* Setting specific, **difficult goals** consistently leads to higher performance than just urging people to do their best
* Goals are energizing. High goals generate greater effort than low goals, and the highest or most difficult goals produce the **greatest levels of effort and performance**
* **Tight deadlines** lead to a more rapid work pace than loose deadlines
* Making a **public commitment** to a goal enhances personal commitment
* Whether the goal is set by **mutual agreement or by the boss** doesn't make a big difference in goal achievement

Proponents of goal setting claim that a positive linear relationship exists between the difficulty of a goal and employee performance. Specifically, they argue that goals should be set at the most challenging level possible to inspire effort, commitment and performance - but not so challenging that employees see no point in trying. This logic makes intuitive sense, yet stretch goals also cause serious (negative) side effects: shifting **risk attitudes**, promoting **unethical behavior**, and triggering the **psychological costs** of goal failure. 

As long as we understand that goal setting has some limitations, setting appropriate goals is a vital part of the performance appraisal process. Goal setting is most appropriate in the **Results** dimension of the job. 

#### Sources of Goals
{:.no_toc}

* Cheaper/faster/better
* Company mission statement/vision and values
* Job description
* Critical job responsibilities
* Division/department plans and strategies

#### Goals Grid
{:.no_toc}

* What do you want that you don't have (achieve)
* What do you want that you already have (preserve)
* What don't you want that you don't have (avoid)
* What do you have now that you don't want (eliminate)

#### Bad ideas in goal setting
{:.no_toc}

1. **(Bad idea) SMART goals** Use SMART test only to check whether goals are well written, not to determine whether they're wise
2. **(Bad idea) Cascading goals** Unnecessary rigid hung up that all goals must cascade down, slowing down the whole process
3. **(Bad idea) Requiring percentage weight for goals** Don't go any more granular than High, Medium and Low goals
4. **(Bad idea) Setting numerous goals** Limit the number of goals to three or four that are tough, specific, and have a significant impact on the success of the department or the business as a whole
5. **(Bad idea) Using the Balanced Scorecard throughout the organization** Forcing the rigid application of the Balanced Scorecard hinders rather than helps goal setting
6. **(Bad idea) Setting goals based on individuals' capabilities rather than on business needs** Set the goals based on needs of business rather than capabilities of an individual

## Chapter 3. Determining Key Job Responsibilities

**Goals** describe what one is going to do *in addition* to meeting one's **key job responsibilities**. Use KRAs and KPIs to identify **key job responsibilities** as figuring them from *Job Descriptions* is *not very effective* as JDs are fairly generic. 

#### KRAs and KPIs
{:.no_toc}

**Key Responsibility Areas (KRA)** tell where the individual is supposed to concentrate their attention.

Vital or key responsibilities of a job are called **Big Rocks**. They are the most important responsibilities of a job, described in a simple statement in verb/noun form, without any indication of how often the person engages in this activity, what its components are, how the quality of performance will be measured. Big Rocks are standalone features of a job, without any overlap. a few big rocks as an example

| Negotiate contracts | Resolve complaints |  
| Lead team | Coordinate services |
| Evaluate performance | Keep users informed |
| Acquire new business | Retain existing customers |
| Sell product | Manage territory |
| Generate leads | File reports |

KRAs, Big Rocks and Key Job Responsibilities are same things. KPIs help measure performance to achieve Big Rocks.  

**Key Performance Indicators (KPI)** tell how performance in specific Big Rock areas will be measured. In order to define KPI's, Look at four measures of output for each Big Rock

* Quality (how well the individual performed)
* Quantity (the amount of work the person did)
* Cost (the degree to which the person adhered to budget or was cost-conscious in going about the job)
* Time (the extent to which schedules and deadlines were met - timeliness)

Quality will be measured using *qualitative descriptive measures* and *examples*. Other measures would likely be *quantitative*. 
Don't try to describe performance at an ideal or Exceeds Expectations level - just be clear about what *Fully Successful* looks like. 

## Chapter 4. Identifying and using competencies

Competencies describe the *knowledge, skills, behaviors, attributes, abilities and attitudes* that are essential to achieving the results expected. 

Three types of competencies
- **Core competencies**: cultural or organizational, for example, communication skill, interpersonal skills and continuous improvement. 
- **Job-family competencies** for a particular type or classification of job. For example, in
	- *operations*: dependability, follow-up, protection of assets and safety
	- *supervisory/managerial*: team leadership, motivating subordinates and others, and developing and retaining talent
	- *administrative*: time management, planning and organizing and professional presence/business demeanor
	- *professional/technical*: problem solving 
- **Job-specific competencies**: specific skills and abilities required to perform a particular job at a successful level, for example, operations manager would require negotiation skills and conflict resolution skills

#### Core Competencies
{:.no_toc}

Typically available from senior executive team. If simple description doesn't exist, determine how should the team demonstrate company's competencies in their day-to-day performance. Get the team involved and ask them to come up with *non-examples* as well as *examples*.

#### Job-Family and Job-Specific Competencies
{:.no_toc}

Define two sets of competencies
- Supervisory competencies
- Individual contributor competencies  

however some will overlap, such as "problem solving".

3-5 competencies are ideal, no more than 7-8. Some examples how to describe excellent performance in competencies

* **Attendance/Punctuality/Dependability**: Comes to work on time every day. Is fully prepared and ready to work at beginning of work schedule and continues until work day is done. Makes appropriate arrangements when adverse weather or other problems might delay on-time arrival. Conforms to work hours and schedule. Lets supervisor and others know immediately when unexpected problems cause absence, lateness, or the need to leave early.  

* **Job Knowledge/Technical Skills**: Is an expert in doing his or her job. Seen as a resource by others. Has a great deal of relevant experience. Makes good suggestions about ways to improve. Can explain the mission of both his or her own work unit, other units and how they work together to meet organizational objectives. Makes active efforts to stay up-to-date. Requires minimal supervision.   

* **Relationship Building**: Builds and maintain a network of contacts useful in achieving work-related goals. Extends and accepts invitation from others to build effective working relationships. Skilled in building rapport with a wide variety of individuals. Understands the balance between taking time to build rapport and getting the work done. Sensitive to what people around him or her are feeling. Promotes the contributions and accomplishments of customers or clients to others. Enthusiastic about others' ideas.  

* **Strategic Thinking**: Understands and can explain the organization's mission and its plan for achieving it. Develops strategies to achieve department and organizational goals. Clearly understands market, customers, competition, and technology. Demonstrates a track record of significant and successful innovation. Knows organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Moves beyond "cheaper/faster/better" to seek truly transformational change. Carefully considers and successfully implements ideas that seem nontraditional or radical. Quickly adapts strategy to respond to changing conditions. Able to develop persuasive and compelling long-term (three- to five-year) plans.

Publicize the competency list with the descriptions of expert-level behaviors. People really want to know what's expected of them. 

## Chapter 5. Providing day-to-day Coaching
Once goals, responsibilities and competencies are clear, people can do their jobs with the peace of mind that comes from having clear direction. Your primary performance appraisal responsibility between start-of-year performance planning and end-of-year performance appraisal is to provide coaching for your team members to help them increase the quality of their performance.
In a survey, the Corporate Leadership Council reported that only 34% of employees felt that the informal feedback the received was fair and accurate. 

Make coaching both **calendar-** and **event-**driven.
* Three months is a reasonable time frame. Book time in calendars ~45 minutes. Suggested format
	* Start with the question - *what major events have taken place since the last time we got together?*
	* Review major activities, successes, problems, lessons learned
* Midyear reviews, suggested format
	* highlight areas of particular successes and areas where performance needs to be improved
	* update goals achieved or abandoned, add new projects or adjust key job responsibilities
* Event driven reviews. *leader-initiated* coaching sessions triggered 
	* after the completion of a major project, regardless of the outcome. Coaching is particularly valuable, and appreciated, when it follows a significant success
	* when one of your employees is experiencing difficulties in getting a job done
	* when an individual is expressing frustration or dissatisfaction with the job
	* when an individual's mood or temperament on the job varies from normal and such mood swings last for more than a couple of days

Coaching **_is_**
* Giving **Advice** to help employees improve performance. Offer suggestions based on your experience
* providing employees with **Guidance** to acquire or develop skills and knowledge
* providing employees **Support**, but being there only when employee needs support (not monitoring and controlling employee's every move)
* giving employees **Confidence** in their ability to manage their performance. Positive feedback on things done well, and letting them know areas they need to improve
* helping employees gain greater **Competence** to prepare them for more complex tasks and higher level positions  

Coaching **_isn't_**
* **training**. Coaching happens after training. Training makes people competent; coaching makes them masters.
* **micromanaging** - telling people how to do their jobs or explaining precisely the way you want something done.
* **counseling**. Coaching focuses on work issues; counseling focuses on personal issues. 

Key points of an exemplary coaching session
* Listening
* Using a straightforward approach
* Being supportive
* Assigning responsibility
* Providing guidance 

## Chapter 6. Evaluating the Quality of an Individual's Performance

Communicate clearly the kind of performance that you consider to be worthy of 3 rating (Meets Expectation/Fully Successful) on a 5-level rating scale. Don't attempt to spell out what it will take to earn the highest rating of 5-Distinguished/Greatly Exceeds Expectations.

Its not possible to predict what it will take to consider a person's job performance as Distinguished or Greatly Exceeds Expectations, which is usually a function of innovation and creativity, of seeing an opportunity that no one else noticed, or of discovering a more effective way to get the job done.

Tracking performance during the year
- Keeping a **tracking system**:
	- for *notes*: Journal with tabs for each employee. Reminder to enter notes on regular basis.
	- for *correspondence*: Email folders for each employee
	- for *documents*: A folder with subfolders for each employee
- Requesting **monthly reports**: Brief monthly report with four topic areas:
	- Key accomplishments
	- Disappointments/concerns/problems
	- What will be accomplished next month
	- Suggestions to improve the department's effectiveness or the business as a whole

Writing performance appraisals requires a manager to be fair, unprejudiced and objective. "**Objectivity**" has nothing to do with quantifiability. It means to be 
- uninfluenced by emotions or personal prejudices
- fair, factual and basing appraisals on observable phenomenon

Companies demand not only *results*, but insist that people generating those results *behave* in a way that reflects organizational values. Although the results an individual produces may be quantifiable, how they got those results, and the extent to which they modeled the organization's values in generating them, isn't subject to numerical measure. But behavior and adherence to values can certainly be described, and those descriptions of performance, supported by examples, are certainly objective. 

> Not everything that counts can be counted. And not everything that can be counted counts - Albert Einstein.

To evaluate someone's performance, 
- first, **start with the Job**, not with the Person. Read the job description and ask yourself
	- The reason the company created this job is to ...
	- The most important ways a person doing the job should spent time are ...
	- The two or three most important duties of someone in this position are ...
	- If someone asked me what it takes to be successful in this job, I would say, ...
	- The easiest way to determine whether this job is being done well is by ...
- then, **compare** the individual's performance with the performance of everyone else on the team, and
- finally, **assess** the Individual based on the following criteria
	- **Ambition/initiative** - demonstrate ambition in the position; perform it, not move out of it. Take initiative to improve process, product and overall work environment
	- **Attendance**
	- **Attitude/cooperation** - pleasure or a chore to work with? reasonably flexible when asked to perform a job function outside his or her normal job duties? 
	- **Communication** skills
	- **Department and company oriented** - broader view and deeper understanding beyond simply their own duties? 
	- **Focus**
	- **Improvement** from previous evaluation
	- **Integrity** - ethical behavior in workplace? respect privacy of others?
	- **Knows when to ask**
	- Level of **technical knowledge** - demonstrate acceptable level of technical knowledge to do the job? Do other people seek this individual out when they run into problems?
	- **Productivity**/deadlines
	- **Quality** of work - feedback regarding quality of work
	- **Reliability**/go-to person - consistently demonstrate competence and dependability? go-to person? 
	- **Stress management** - deal with change in work environment? filter out the noise and focus on task? 
	- **Teamwork/pitching in** - willingly pitching in to finish tasks assigned to others, where appropriate? volunteer to assist? 

#### Is self-appraisal a good idea?
{:.no_toc}

It's not a good idea, because an appraisal is a record of the supervisor's opinion. Research suggests individuals are notoriously inaccurate in assessing their own performance, and the poorer the performer, the higher (and more inaccurate) the self-assessment. 

Research by Lominger, Inc. indicates that "the overall correlation between self-ratings and performance was .00. The most accurate rather by far is the immediate boss". In their article "Unskilled and Unaware of it: How difficulties in recognizing own incompetence lead t0 inflated self-assessments". Those who are incompetent performance are also incapable of assessing the difference between good and bad performance. 

Asking the individual to write a self-appraisal encourages misunderstanding by both parties.

If self-appraisals are necessitated, a more effective approach is for the supervisor to ask employee to send him an informal list of their most important accomplishments and achievement during the appraisal period (send in an email). This good stuff will provide useful data for the supervisor to write an objective appraisal. 

**Rating errors** that supervisors need to be aware of
* Central tendency - rating everyone in the middle
* Halo/Horns effect - letting one aspect of the individual's performance impact other unrelated areas
* Similar-to-me effect
* Recency effect - recent minor events having more impact on rating than distant major events
* Hired or inherited issue
* Attractiveness effect

## Chapter 7. Using your appraisal form
Every appraisal of an individual requires considering two components: behaviors and results. Form should cover
* behavior and results
* section for goals
* space for comments (individual items and summary)
* rating scale and labels for ratings
* space for employee comments
* section on development

Distribution guidelines typically have a positive skew by design, as its not appropriate to expect performance appraisal ratings to distribute normally since organizations are not composed of a random collection of individuals (organizations strive to obtain the best talent available)

| Extraordinary Results | 5% |
| Very Strong Results | 20% |
| Strong Results | 60% |
| Results need to be improved | 10% |
| Unacceptable Results | 5% |

## Chapter 8. Preparing for the Appraisal Discussion

Use Calibration sessions to help ensure consistency in ratings. A manager's role in calibrations sessions is not to defend her ratings, but to explain their rationale for those ratings, listen carefully to the input from other supervisors and if needed, adjust the rating up or down to make it consistent department-wide.

Voting, back-room coalitions and mutual back-scratching agreements ("I'll support your rating for X if you do the same for me with Y") are inappropriate behaviors in Calibration sessions to watch out for. 

#### Preparing the individual
{:.no_toc}

Its helpful to prepare the individual psychologically or intellectually for the appraisal meeting so the person can get maximum benefit from it. A day or two before the meeting, you can maximize the learning power of the appraisal discussion by sending an e-mail to the individual to reflect a bit on their job and career considering some questions:

* Has the past year been better or worse for you than previous years in this job?
* What do you consider to be your most important achievements or accomplishments in the past year? (ask only if you haven't already asked for this list)
* What do you most like or dislike about working for this organization?
* What parts of the job do you find most and least interesting?
* What do you consider to be your most important tasks and aims for the upcoming year? 
* What can I as your manager or the organization as a whole do to help you be more successful?

The answers to these questions don't need to be written down, just reflected upon. 

Another effective approach is to give the individual a copy of the appraisal an hour or two beforehand with the request that they read it and write down any notes or questions they'd like to discuss in the upcoming meeting.

The suggestions about need to be disregarded for marginal employees - rating 1 or 2 on a 5-level scale. Don't give the person a copy of the appraisal beforehand. 

## Chapter 9. Conduction the Performance Appraisal

PA meetings are typically structured in one of three ways

* **Successes and positives**: The dominant tone is celebration of success. 
* **Areas of improvement and problem solving**:The dominant tone is serious but constructive, appropriate to solving problems.
* **Balanced message**: Traditional and categorically wrong approach. Feedback sandwich technique - start with a positive note, then discuss unpleasant stuff, then close on an positive note acknowledging the employee's contributions followed by a discussion of employee's plans and goals for the next 12 months. 

Balanced message approach is a time-proven failure. It is meant to allow manager to deliver message across without destroying the morale and incentive of an employee. However this not true, this approach does not deliver a single clear message, it annoys and demotivates the good performer and cheers and heartens the poor performer - exactly the opposite of the result that a good manager wants from PA discussions!

#### Concentrating on strengths
{:.no_toc}

Corporate Leadership Council study [Managing for High Performance and Retention](http://ceboard.vo.llnwd.net/o1/HRMedia/Vendor/Delivering%20Future_Focused%20Performance%20Feedback/story_content/external_files/Managing%20for%20High%20Performance.pdf) found *"fairness and accuracy of information feedback"* as the top factor generating a *"percentage performance increase"* of over 39%. The third most important factor at over 36% was *"emphasis in performance review on performance strengths"*. On the other hand, the study also found *"emphasis in appraisals on performance weaknesses"* actually reduces performance by almost 27%. Also critical was timing - when and how feedback was given. "Immediate feedback to improve job performance" was 8th at 26% on the list of 105 factors boosting performance.

#### Concentrating on improvement needs
{:.no_toc}

Study indicated in the article [Bad Is Stronger Than Good: Evidence-Based Advice For Bosses](https://hbr.org/2010/09/bad-is-stronger-than-good-evid) looks at the effects of toxic colleagues and de-energizers on work groups, including

* deadbeats (withholders of effort),
* downers (who express pessimism, anxiety, insecurity and irritation) and
* assholes (who violate interpersonal norms of respect).

Study estimates that a team with just one person in any of these categories suffers a performance disadvantage of 30% - 40% compare to team that have no bad apples. 

#### Recommended approach for performance appraisal meetings
{:.no_toc}

Concentrating on strengths and improvements both have a place in performance appraisal process however they should not be combined. Unlike the balanced message approach, it is best to focus on one message or the other. Mixed messages don't work.

Human performance is a function of two variables, behaviors and results. Plotting these on XY axis reveals five different positions

* Stars - display appropriate behavior and achieve great results. Role models. 5-star. 
* Journeymen - solid performers. Meet expectations and/or exceed expectations in one or two areas. 
* Failures
* Lovable Losers
* Prima Donnas - Vain, undisciplined, egotistical, obnoxious or temperamental person who finds it difficult to work under direction or as part of a team.

**With Stars and Journeymen**, you should focus almost exclusively on the recognition and celebration of success. Recognize that the word *but* is the great eraser. No matter how positively you may talk about the individual's performance and how many successes and achievements you mention, the instant the word *but* (or its equally pernicious cousin *however*) leaves your lips, everything you've said up to that point will be negated. So don't say it. Stay focused exclusively on success and your recognition of that success. The odds are good that employee will bring bring the conversation around to ares of deficiency or needs for performance improvement simply because you haven't raised them yourself. Top performers are the ones who are usually most self-critical. 

**With Failures, Lovable Losers and Prima Donnas**, you should focus on the need for an immediate and total turnaround if the person is to remain employed. If strengths are discussed, it should be only to acknowledge that while the employee has demonstrated their existence, these strengths either haven't been deployed for the organization's benefit or have been rendered insignificant because of the severity of the employee's problem areas. You don't want the person to fixate on the small amount of positive information they hear and fail to understand the core message - that their performance is unacceptable and must immediately be corrected. As in the case of sandwich technique, you don't want the person to walk out of the appraisal conversation with the feeling that all must be well since both good stuff and not-so-good stuff, as always, was discussed.

**In conducting discussion with marginal performer**, Paul Falcone, VP HR of Time Warner Cable, observes that perception is reality until proven otherwise. Falcone recommends that the manager start by stating his precise concern, follow with the examples that generated the manager's perception, then close with a request for the employee's reaction to that perception or with a specific request for change (letting the person know what's necessary to continue in the role).
