I love solving complex problems in simple, brilliant ways.

Simplicity in achieving lasting business change along with all the processes and solutions that go with it doesn't come easy. It's seldom a one-man show.

Comfortable working independently but believes real magic is in team play. Ali strives to build high performing teams, delegating and empowering, yet being able to take the lead if necessary.

Simple is hard work! Nevertheless, with focus and synergy, great business outcomes become a reality regardless of problem of any given complexity.

Always hungry to learn, Ali acquires new knowledge quickly, and also eager to apply latest relevant knowledge to work if it makes life easier for everyone. Here are the key things Ali is most motivated by and passionate about

* Leading and being part of great teams
* Delivering business change and outcomes coherently
* Designing and managing smart (low paperwork) programs and projects
* Solving problems in new ways especially using data
* Communicating insights in a simple and actionable way
