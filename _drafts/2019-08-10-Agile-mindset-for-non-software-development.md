## Why this guide

Every agile training I've been to says Agile can be applied to any environment yet very little information is out there to actually show how. What's a 'Release' for a team that only does audits and process improvement analysis? How do you break down the complex process spanning across a University and deliver chunks of it every two weeks. 

The team I work for is about improving student experience while they attend a University. We look at all aspects of student journey including how they choose the University, go through application process to be admitted, enrol to study the units they like, learn and interact with their teachers and peers, progress through their course, achieve success and graduate. What also matters to us is how they stay connected to the University as Alumni and hopefully even come back to study more again.

Most of our work is Innovation - finding new or better ways of improving student experience. We  audit and benchmark current systems, processes, and underlying data. We also listen to end-users (students or staff) to understand their concerns and expectations. We find gaps, analyse them, challenge status quo, test new hypotheses and recommend new or better ways. We experiment new approaches engaging stakeholders across the organisation and embed successful trials in business as usual. Operational transition of new ways often involves change management of processes, technology or information. The trials could also involve development of software however that's only a small portion of what we do.

So how could one apply Agile mindset to this setting? This article explains the key questions and how I addressed them. I hope others in similar setting of trying to adapt Agile mindset in a non- software development setting will benefit.

#### How do we configure milestones?

User Jira release functionality to define milestones. Link epics to Fix/Versions.  

#### Add an epic in portfolio adds it to all plans?

This is because the whole board is imported as issues source when creating a plan, instead use a Jira filter to filter on Label.
This will be solved by Initiative addition.

#### How do we configure notifications? 


#### How do we import issues to plans? 

Initiatives

What's a sprint?

How do you setup your dashboard?

What is a backlog?

What is filtering?

Have participants create an issue and estimate story points, assignee, etc. (this is because there are several clicks to get the to estimate section, it doesn't appear when you first click the issue)

How to comment, respond to a comment and tag people?

If someone is tagged in a card, what does that mean? What do they need to do?

How will Jira integrate with the programs and potentially the Team Plan?
