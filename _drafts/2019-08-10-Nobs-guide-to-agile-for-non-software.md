## Why this guide

Every agile training I've been to says agile can be applied to any environment yet very little information is out there to actually show how. 

Our team works on improving customer experience throughout their journey while they come to study at a university. This includes the application and admission experience, enrolment process, learning, achieving, graduating and staying connected to the university as alumni.

Most of our work is innovative, finding new or better ways improving student experience. A key aspect of our work is auditing and benchmarking current systems, data and processes serving students through their journey. We listen to end-users, find gaps, analyze them, create hypotheses and recommend new or better ways. These, we then validate using experiments along with stakeholders across the organization. Embedding successful trials in organisation often involve change of processes, technology or information. The trials could involve development of small software applications as well but that is only a small portion of what we do. 

So how could one apply agile mindset to this setting? This article explains the key questions and how I addressed them in the hope that other in similar setting will benefit.

#### How do we configure milestones?

User Jira release functionality to define milestones. Link epics to Fix/Versions.  

#### Add an epic in portfolio adds it to all plans?

This is because the whole board is imported as issues source when creating a plan, instead use a Jira filter to filter on Label.
This will be solved by Initiative addition.

#### How do we configure notifications? 


#### How do we import issues to plans?
