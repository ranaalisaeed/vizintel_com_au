#### Herzberg's theory of motivation
Published work in *The Motivation to Work* showed that in general people will be initially motivated to achieve extrinsic needs ('hygiene' factors) at work because they are unhappy without them,however the effect soon wears off - that is, the job satisfaction is temporary. People are only truly motivated when they satisfy their intrinsic needs ('motivators'). 

| Extrinsic needs | Intrinsic needs (motivators) |
