## Sunday - What's in it for me?

If you want people to be motivated for a long period of time, the drive must come from within them. 

#### Herzberg's theory of motivation
{:.no_toc}

Published work in *The Motivation to Work* showed that in general people will be initially motivated to achieve extrinsic needs ('hygiene' factors) at work because they are unhappy without them, however the effect soon wears off - that is, such job satisfaction is temporary. People are only truly motivated when they satisfy their intrinsic needs ('motivators'). 

| Extrinsic needs | Intrinsic needs (motivators) |
|:------------- |:-------------|
| Company policy | Achievement |
| Supervision | Recognition |
| Salary | Work itself |
| Interpersonal relations | Responsibility |
| Physical working conditions | Advancement |

#### Meta Programs
{:.no_toc}

Mental processes that enable us to filter the mass of information that we take in each day, and to decide on which bits should we pay attention to. To work out what filters someone uses, pay attention to the language they use. 

Key mental patterns and how to effect their motivation:

* **Away from -vs- Towards**:
	* 'Towards' will want to know about rewards, future achievements, goals
	* 'Away from' focused on avoiding pain or problems. They talk about what they don't want to happen e.g. words like reduce, avoid, minimize and get away from. You'll need to explain how the task will avoid pain, problems, outcomes they don't want. This also links to "Loss Aversion" theory developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1984), which highlights people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains
* **Reactive -vs- Proactive**: 
	* *Proactive* will accept a job without all details as they just like to get started. Like to be told "go for it" or just do it
	* *Reactive* will prefer to wait and see what others do first. Like to be given direction on task before they get started 
* **Internal -vs- External**: 
	* *Internals* don't need recognition from others to feel validated. Prefer to make their own decisions and have no need to get confirmation from others (e.g. regular review is less important)
	* *Externals* need others to tell them how they're doing. A regular review will be important as they want to know that they're doing a good job
* **Options -vs- Procedures**: 
	* *Options* will rarely make a quick decision without looking at all options available. May feel threatened with lack of choice
	* *Procedures* like processes and following a 'tried-and-tested' method, prefer knowing the right way of carrying out a task
* **Global -vs- Specific**: 
	* *Globals* like the big picture, overview or summary. Like to be presented with key points and don't mind things being vague
	* *Specifics* enjoy the detail and want others to have all the information that they believe is important. Prefer having precise detail and factual information
* **Sameness -vs- Difference**: 
	* *Sameness* enjoy things remaining constant and, if they get a new task, they want to know how it is similar to something they're already familiar with
	* *Difference* enjoy change and are motivated by things being new and unfamiliar

#### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
{:.no_toc}

Don't expect to be able to motivate someone at a higher level when they feel their needs at a lower level are not being met.

Some ways to apply Maslow's theory at work

* **Physiological needs** - provide ample breaks for lunch and recuperation and pay salaries
* **Safety needs** - safe working environment, job security and freedom from threats
* **Social needs** - generate a feeling of acceptance, belonging and community by encouraging team work
* **Esteem needs** - recognize achievements, assign important projects, make employees feel valued and appreciated
* **Self-actualization** - offer challenging and meaningful work assignments that enable innovation, creativity and progress according to long-term goals

#### McClelland's Human Motivation Theory
{:.no_toc}

There are three main motivators we all have - **Achievement**, **Affiliation** and **Power**, and each of us will display different characteristics depending on our dominant motivator, which has been shaped by our background, culture and life experiences.

| Dominant motivator | Characteristics of the person |
|----|----|
| Achievement | * has a need to set & achieve challenging goals<br/>* likes to take risks to achieve goals<br/>* enjoys getting feedback on progress towards their goals<br/>* often prefers to work alone |
| Affiliation | * has need to be liked or be part of a group<br/>* may tend to go along with what others want in order to maintain harmony and good relations in a group<br/>* does not enjoy risk taking and uncertainty |
| Power | * enjoys having power and influence over others<br/>* enjoys competing and winning<br/>* likes recognition and status |
