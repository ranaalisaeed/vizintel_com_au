## Introduction

This book explores how some organizations are learning how to operate in a way that is potentially better for those doing the work, better for those for whom the work is being done, better for the organizations themselves, and better for society. These organizations form a vast global movement that is transoforming the world of work. The movement began several dacades ago, but took off in a major way more recently in an unexpected place: software development. It is now spreading to all parts, all kinds, of organizations - big firms and small, simple and complex, software and hardware, technology, manufacturing, health, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, aircraft, and automobiles - you name it. This new paradigm permits an organization to flourish in a marketplace that is increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous - the so called VUCA world.

The new management paradigm is a journey, not a destination. It involves never-ending innovation, both in terms of specific innovations that the organisation generates for the customer and the steady improvements to the practice of management itself. A firm never arrives at a steady state where it can relax because "we are now Agile". Embracing the new paradigm requires continuous commitment and leadership from management.

This book answers three simple questions. How do organizations flourish in a VUCA world, where the customer is in charge of the marketplace? Why has embracing the new way of running organizations become a necessity? What can leaders at all levels of the society do to create a more energizing, prosperous, and meaningful mode of working and living?

## More value from less work

Business success in the twenty-first century increasingly depends on becoming an nimble as the rapidly shifting and unpredictable context.

Agile management is about working smarter rather than harder. It's not abotu doing more work in less time: It's about generating more value from less work. 

Bureaucracy was designed to produce merely consistent average performance according to internal rules set by the organization itself. 

Organizations that have embraced Agile have three core characteristics: 

1. The Law of the Small Team - work should be done in small, autonomous, cross-functional teams working in short cycles on relatively small tasks and getting continuous feedback from the ultimate customer or end-user. Big and complex problems are resolved by descaling them into tiny, manageable pieces
2. The Law of the Customer
3. The Law of the Network
