#### Why is this a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* In truth, or we can ever control is ourselves
*  circumstances are ultimately less determinant of our results than our responses to them
*  a sense of control gives us focus and allows us to access our unique personal power

>  we need to play the cards we are dealt

> You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.

Mindset is described as a conscious decision to see the best in a situation. 

We all have controlables in our lives, places where we can have the most impact and drive the most effective results


## Resource Management

> Whether is time, money, energy of people, all resources are finite, and managing time is critical to any success

#### Why is this a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* With the exception of imagination, all of the research is a finite
*  no one ever has all they would like, so we need to have strategies to make what we have work 
* an inability to prioritise resources or make choices powerfully can lead to catastrophic failure

> until we can manage time we can manage nothing else

What is harder to measure and manage is assets that have intangible value. Thanks such as personal energy, mental health, wellness, enthusiasm, trust, reputation, attention, focus and potential are just some of the important intangibles you have at your disposal

We all trade in energy. No-one wants to work with or for a lackluster person who is tired and jaded. Energy is one of the most important resources you have. it just happens to be intangible.

A capacity to choose a frame of reference that inspires urgency and action is critical to making us appreciate time, money, energy and even tangible resources

The issue is not that things go wrong, its that we make no provision for when things go wrong. And managing resources is one of those skills where things going wrong can cost us economically and commercially. 



## Order

>  whether we see consensus or mould consensus, the need for social order will remain 

#### Why is it a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* As long as human beings decide to co-exist in large social structures we will need to negotiate a consensus of acceptable behaviour
* Not all of us are willing to play by the rules and abide by these community conventions
* Just occasionally, for the good of the many over the desires of the few, social order must be enforced and perhaps even forced

Five steps for making order based decisions under pressing conditions

1. assess what information you have
2. generate options for how your decision might play out
3. make assessments on positives and negatives
4. Refer to your own experience or engage those who have more
5. use deadlines to spur action and avoid perfectionism


## Implementation

> The most effective way to do it, is to do it - Amelia Earhart

> Well done is better than well said - Benjamin Franklin

#### Why is it a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* Intent is cheap; what matters is action
* An ability to be decisive and execute is a fundamental skills of leadership
* Performance and action drive engagement, not the other way around

We like a little choice, but too much can be paralyzing and we end up making no choice at all. 

The skill of finishing this just as crucial as beginning.The ability to stay the course, to keep goingAnd not be distracted by the new or the immediate very much distinguishes between those who succeed and those who simply dream about it. So ask yourself

* what is the first thing I need to do to get me on the way
* what is the most important thing I can do to progress my project right now
* what will be required of me to complete it
