# CREATIVITY SKILLS

Creativity skills are important because they help us solve problems, find new ways to do things, change the status quo and ultimately move the human race forward. Creativity is a key area of forever skills and it's one we all need to develop.

Creativity is the ability to think, to solve problems in ways we haven't seen before. It is Innovation, flexibility, agility, ingenuity and mental fluidity. All things that will be incredibly useful for our ongoing success, no matter what the future brings

## Insight

Critical factors making inside of whatever skill

* Data requires sense-making to give it meaning
* data is only as reliable as it's quality, completeness and focus
* good judgement must sometimes be exercised in imperfect conditions 

We would always need to combine data and information with judgement, observation, interpretation, logic and experience, suspicions, gases and even get responses to make sense and create meaning. In doing so, the date I can be used to generate new ideas. To create change. To make progress. To imagine what doesn't exist yet.

When we apply systems thinking to a problem we realise that Solutions are really singular and often it is an unforeseen change that causes assistant to break (making it hard to prepare for).

Dr Natassia Goode is a senior research fellow in the centre of human factors and Sociotechnical Systems at the University of the Sunshine Coast. She's an expert in system thinking and accident causation. She encourages businesses to use systems thinking models to analyse incidents in the workplace, rather than focusing on the behaviour of injured workers. 

Data is not an answer, it's input.

## Conversion

> we have always engaged with the skills of conversion: turning seeds into bread, coal into power and ideas into innovation

Conversion is the quest for transmutation, adaptation, reframing, re-invention and re-interpretation and it's as relevant today as it has ever been.

#### Why is this a forever skill

* Products, services and tools tend to change but emotional and psychological needs they satisfy often remain
* Innovation and shifts in business models are many times the result of looking outside of an industry or category for inspiration
* Recycling and upcycling has always been with us and it's of increasing importance from environmental and sustainability point of view

Successful people are constantly looking for lessons they can take and use elsewhere. No experience goes to waste. Their mindset is one of "What can I take from this?". It's critical to be able to take key concepts, experiences and skills and then redeployed them in new situations, applications and roles.

'Macro-ing' is the ability to identify, replicate and apply big themes and concepts to multiple situations and jurisdictions and 'mixing' is the ability to blend different skills, inputs and ideas from multiple sources into coherent new ideas.

> innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way

According to Steve Jobs, 'Creativity is just connecting things, when you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something.'

Many business success stories that grab headlines today are prime examples of the power of conversion; taking under-utilised resources and transforming them into something useful. Consider Uber, Airbnb, Airtasker, many of the makers on Etsy, and, yes, even Tinder.

Conversion is a capability that has defined human advancement throughout history. It's more than an ability to create and utilise tools; it's the ability to recognise and realise the value in people and resources and to unlock that value and activate it for commercial or social gain. 


## Problem solving

#### Why is this a forever skills

* problems are becoming increasingly complex
* problems are where opportunities hide
* the greatest impact we can make on our performance lies in our ability to solve the problems that most people are unwilling to face

At its core, creativity is a problem-solving skill. Not all creative emerges from an awareness of a problem, but rather it is informed by a mindset of "How could this be better?"

The problem with thinking in statements is that they presuppose a solution. There's a big difference between the statement "we need to build a bridge" and the question "how might we get across a body of water?". We need to teach ourselves to turn statements into questions when we are problem solving. This actively forces brain to consider different solutions and look for connections otherwise it wouldn't.

Creativity requires constant adjustment, a willingness to fail and to try a new approach. 

* WD40 is named for its iteration in the learning curve - its Water Displacement formula number 40 (after 39 failures)
* Angry Birds was the developers' 103rd attempt to create a killer app.


## Agility

> despite the many cliches surrounding Darwin's work, it is not the strongest who survives, but rather the most adaptable

The willingness to relearn and create something new is a creative agility skill that many high achievers and great leaders have in common

#### Why is this a forever skill

* the path to success is rarely a straight line
* few endeavours are successful in their first iteration
* resilience is not trying a failed strategy repeatedly, but rather trying a new approach with optimism

6 R's of Resilience

1. Reframe - how we interpret a challenge
2. Regroup - how we collaborate and coordinate with our team and network
3. Rethink - the strategies we decide to put in place
4. Rework - being iterative in the approach we implement
5. Reward - acknowledging progress
6. Reinforce - measuring and maintaining progress

In his book, Useful Belief, Chris Holder says

> I don't teach positive, I teach useful. I don't think truth matters as much as we think it really does. You'll find truth is very much a perception anyway; we've often let other people create our truths.

# COMMUNICATION SKILLS

Communication skills include capabilities such as entrance, engagement, sales, presentation, leadership and other abilities that are often described as the soft skills

Soft skills should be baked into every employee in the digital economy. The demand today is for collaboration, teamwork, UQ, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The skills are important because they are enterprise transferable.

> the biggest skills gap in the United States is soft kids. What most employers want our written communication, oral communication, team-building, and leadership skills - LinkedIn CEO 2018.

Poor communication skills and emotional ignorance are in fact among the most sighted causes of workplace disengagement, staff turnover, broken relationships and a sense of isolation emerging between generations.

## Influence

> Ideas without influence are important

Whether you're a

* leader looking to create buy-in with your team,
* sales or marketing team wanting to sell products or services,
* change agent with a cause you want to champion in your community, or
* parent trying to get your kids to do pretty much anything you want them to,

Influence is it critical skill. Influence allows us to negotiate a deal on our terms, mould opinions, make social change, and build businesses and organisations that generate social and commercial value.

#### Why is this a forever skill

* really does the best win. It is far more likely to be the most influential
* relying on facts rather than influence can actually be counter-productive
* if you can't engage, you really can't lead

Right is not nearly enough, you need to build buy in, you need to learn to influence.

We all are in the business of selling

* if you're a parent, you're selling clean teeth, vegetables and bedtime
* if you're a teacher, you're selling paying attention, working hard and the importance of knowledge
* if you're a leader you are selling a culture worth belonging to, work worth doing and yourself as someone worth following

Make use of __The Selling Stack__ to know what you're really selling, on offering, or delivering, to amplify your influence.

If you want to increase your influence, always think 'What's in it for them?'. 

* to know who your customer is, follow the money. 
* to know who your constituents are, follow the votes.
* to know who's on your side, follow the love and support.

Identity is a function of background, beliefs and behaviours. 

* Background - what context - the geographical, social or technological environment - we operate in
* Beliefs - what do we believe to be true, what is our internal ideology, what values flow from that ideology
* Behaviours - what symbols and language do we use, how do we communicate

Daniel Goleman's 2005 book Emotional Intelligence defines emotional intelligence (EQ) as knowing people, as the application of

1. Rapport - connect people to each other and to us rapidly
2. Mobility - communicate across cultures and social strata
3. Empathy - gain insight beyond your own personal experience
4. Understanding - know what's driving behaviour and opinion
5. Inspiration - elicit an emotional response in others


## Team building

> It turns out the soft skills are actually among the hardest to master.

Gallop’s Global Workforce Engagement Research survey is conduced every year. 2018 results show

* 70% either don't like the work, and in fact hate it.
* organisations that do have an engaged workforce and culture of collaboration and cooperation are more productive, more profitable and even have customer satisfaction ratings that sit significantly above the norm.

#### Why is this a forever skill

* increasing complexity and the need for specialisation
* the myth of solo success
* none of us is as smart as all of us

> You can't outperform your culture - Cultures as Work CEO, Michael Henderson. 

Cultures are not always positive, nor do they always generate the kinds of results we'd like. This is ultimately because culture is a function of our values and how those values are translated into behaviours. Values direct our attention and give us energy, they are also the filter we use to evaluate those around us.

Three important factors that build a culture

* *Coordination* is a very pragmatic function that is all about walking with 'hands'. It's about insuring the right contact is made between the right data and the right people at the right time
* *Cooperation* is more about using the 'head' and requires greater consideration of the people and individuals involved rather than simply being outcome focused
* *Collaboration* is focused more on 'heart' and how to culture is functioning as an organism. Does the work enrich the community while engaging everyone involved? Is the work both rewarding socially and enjoyable personally?

In the world of innovation where new processes, products and services are simply adaptations from one field of endeavour to another. Ask an engineer to solve an engineering problem and you're likely to get a rather predictable engineering response. Ask a retailer, a medical professional and are user experience designer to solve the problem and the solutions presented are likely to be flavoured by the diversity of the input, giving you solutions you otherwise would not have found. The need for cognitive diversity, the variety of thinking and processing styles, is important for building diverse teams.

Consider the following when adding someone to your team:

* Do they challenge me?
* Do they see the world differently to me?
* Do I like them?
* Do I trust them?
* Can I sit on a five-hour flight next to them?

Janine Garner, a networking and collaboration expert, suggest we consider four key people in our team as well as four personality types we try to eliminate from our team. 

We need

* Promoters - people who cheerlead and promote our successes
* Pit Crew - people who sustain us, repair us and keep us going when times are tough
* Teachers - people who increase our knowledge and awareness. They may act as mentors or simply challenge our thinking and understanding around an issue
* Butt kickers - people in our team who know us well, and want us to do more. They're unlikely to buy into our BS or let us get away with it

We need to avoid

* Burners - people who like to keep you small, fill your head with doubts and encourage you to stay within the lines and play to the status quo
* Underminers - people who make you feel you constantly need to defend and justify yourself
* Judgers - judgement can become toxic if it breads negativity or limits your potential and stifles growth
* Fighters - people who are just hard work because they will wrestle you in the direction of success on a daily basis

Focus on results, not just roles in your team. Build interconnected networks that are more 'web-like' and less 'tower-like' to be build effective teams.

## Trust

> Your reputation is not what you say about yourself. It is what other people say when you're not in the room.

Spotify CEO describes a metaphor they use within the organisation to measure the level of trust that exists between team members. They call it the ‘trust battery’. When you start work at the organisation your trust battery has a 50% charge. Then, over what time, the battery either gains or loses charge based on the interactions you have with other team members. Have you lived up to your work and worked efficiently and harmoniously with other team members of the team?

Trust is also a rather fragile thing, slow to earn and quick to lose. An old Dutch saying goes “trust arrives walking and leaves riding”.

> What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you are saying - Ralph Waldo, American philosopher

#### Why is this a forever skill

* Accountability is increasing as people have greater and more immediate access to information
* We’re more connected which means opinions can now be amplified more quickly and more widely
* Trust beats truth

Thought leadership goes beyond mere expertise, it requires an ability to create new and distinct intellectual property that adds to existing knowledge and wisdom in your professional sphere.

Thought leaders move us forward. Often they challenge us, our ways of thinking, our ways of doing things and the comfort of the status quo. This means we will always need them if you want progress.

Confusion, uncertainty and helplessness induce fear and dread when we are unsure of our situation. These fears escalate when no one takes responsibility, is in control or is contactable. Fears turn in to panic that spreads rapidly when our emotional and logical minds feed-back and reinforce each other. These emotions are often more frightening than the problem itself. The key during a crisis is to communicate you are in control, actively dealing with the issue and then un-powering people's fears. Tell the truth, explain what has happened, what will happen and what every person must do. And when you think you have communicated enough, double it. When you resolve people's fears and give them a path to safety, that is when you create calm, teamwork and trust.

> when you walk your talk, others talk about it too

Ship is one of the most influential customer service experts. His book, The Amazing Revolution, is a testament to delivering above and beyond customers’ expectations. Ships guarding at tours is that people do business with people, not organisations, you want in the online space. When something amazing happens, something we weren't expecting, something surprisingly exciting, we tell that story to everyone we meet.

Trip advisor is the most influential travel organisations on the planet. They don't own any hotels, fleet of aircraft, coaches or ships, and they aren’t representatives of any particular nation’s travel authority. All the essentially do is curated other people's opinions. There entire business model is built on trust and reputation rather than the budget and scale of a marketing campaign.

## Traslation

> Communication isn't about the transmission and reception of information; it's about moving towards a shared sense of meaning

Translation skill is the capacity to assess, curate, interpret and share ideas and information across different professional, social and cultural spheres

#### Why is this a forever skill

* we’re overloaded with information
* understanding is more important than accuracy
* teaching, instruction and mentoring are forever needs

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough - Albert Einstein

Here are some techniques to help simplify

* Metaphor. Metaphor and comparison are perhaps the simplest forms of translation there is, linking the new to what is already familiar and understood.
* Brevity. This is a capacity to eliminate the unnecessary. Try writing what you may want to say in longhand then remove words until it no longer makes sense. Then replace the last word you removed.
* Chunking down. It said that the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. The ability to chunk a process down into achievable steps and to communicate the steps to our teams is also essential in tackling any complicated task or undertaking.
* Easy wins. And important with building engagement and confidence is to create easy wins and build on that progress.
* Identify essentials. Most of the time, success doesn't depend upon us having all of the information at the same time, or even before we begin. what this means is, we need to prioritise what is essential, what can wait and what can be ignored or together.

> Understand what a win looks like and to decide what is essential in achieving that win

London tube map was created by someone who had no experience in mapmaking and could, therefore, ignore relative distance and scale. In the end, the Tube Map he created was adopted and became the convention for underground railway maps the world over.

Information isn’t enough, we need to educate learners working through multiple tools, languages and tonalities to help them learn in a practical way, here’s how we should educate:

* focus on progress
* make that progress visible
* be entertaining in the way we deliver information. Learning should be memorable and interesting
* empathize with those we’re instructing. Understand how what we’re teaching impact those we’re training
* learn to access to correct problems. We need to discriminate and assess what's really important, to manage cognitive load and decide what’s actually bullshit

> Education is not just about the transmission of information but rather it is about using that information to raise understanding and increase competence. 


# CONTROL SKILLS

## Self-Control

The ability to deal with the situation you find yourself in with humility, acceptance and self-control, is critical to our mental and emotional stability. 

#### Why is this a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* In truth, or we can ever control is ourselves
*  circumstances are ultimately less determinant of our results than our responses to them
*  a sense of control gives us focus and allows us to access our unique personal power

>  we need to play the cards we are dealt

> You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.

Mindset is described as a conscious decision to see the best in a situation. 

We all have controlables in our lives, places where we can have the most impact and drive the most effective results


## Resource Management

> Whether is time, money, energy of people, all resources are finite, and managing time is critical to any success

#### Why is this a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* With the exception of imagination, all of the research is a finite
*  no one ever has all they would like, so we need to have strategies to make what we have work 
* an inability to prioritise resources or make choices powerfully can lead to catastrophic failure

> until we can manage time we can manage nothing else

What is harder to measure and manage is assets that have intangible value. Thanks such as personal energy, mental health, wellness, enthusiasm, trust, reputation, attention, focus and potential are just some of the important intangibles you have at your disposal

We all trade in energy. No-one wants to work with or for a lackluster person who is tired and jaded. Energy is one of the most important resources you have. it just happens to be intangible.

A capacity to choose a frame of reference that inspires urgency and action is critical to making us appreciate time, money, energy and even tangible resources

The issue is not that things go wrong, its that we make no provision for when things go wrong. And managing resources is one of those skills where things going wrong can cost us economically and commercially. 



## Order

>  whether we see consensus or mould consensus, the need for social order will remain 

#### Why is it a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* As long as human beings decide to co-exist in large social structures we will need to negotiate a consensus of acceptable behaviour
* Not all of us are willing to play by the rules and abide by these community conventions
* Just occasionally, for the good of the many over the desires of the few, social order must be enforced and perhaps even forced

Five steps for making order based decisions under pressing conditions

1. assess what information you have
2. generate options for how your decision might play out
3. make assessments on positives and negatives
4. Refer to your own experience or engage those who have more
5. use deadlines to spur action and avoid perfectionism


## Implementation

> The most effective way to do it, is to do it - Amelia Earhart

> Well done is better than well said - Benjamin Franklin

#### Why is it a forever skill
{:.no_toc}

* Intent is cheap; what matters is action
* An ability to be decisive and execute is a fundamental skills of leadership
* Performance and action drive engagement, not the other way around

We like a little choice, but too much can be paralyzing and we end up making no choice at all. 

The skill of finishing this just as crucial as beginning.The ability to stay the course, to keep goingAnd not be distracted by the new or the immediate very much distinguishes between those who succeed and those who simply dream about it. So ask yourself

* what is the first thing I need to do to get me on the way
* what is the most important thing I can do to progress my project right now
* what will be required of me to complete it
