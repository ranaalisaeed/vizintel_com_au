I love solving complex problems in simple, brilliant ways.

Simplicity in achieving lasting business change along with all the processes and solutions that go with it doesn't come easy. It's seldom a one-man show.

I'm comfortable working alone but believe in team play, building high performing teams, delegating and empowering yet being able to take the lead if necessary.

Simple is hard work! Nevertheless, with focus and synergy, we achieve great business outcomes given any problem thrown at us.

Always hungry to learn, I usually acquire new knowledge quickly. I'm also eager to apply latest relevant knowledge to work if it makes life easier for everyone. The things I'm most motivated by and passionate about are

  - Leading and being part of great teams
  - Delivering business change and outcomes
  - Designing and managing low paperwork programs and projects
  - Solving problems in new ways especially using data
  - Communicating insights in a simple and actionable way

Always keen to hear new problems that remain unsolved. Get in touch.
